 <h1>The Best Movies According to Kylie</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Beaches</h3>
 <p>I have watched this movie so many times, it makes me cry during the 
    starting credits  becuase I know what is comming. The characters and thier 
    relationships are real and complex. The acting is next level and I 
    always find something new everytime I watch it. </p>
 <h3>The Wedding Singer</h3>
 <p>A sweet movie full of belly laughs.</p>
 <h3>Grease</h3>
 <p>A fun movie that you can't help but to sing along to. </p>
